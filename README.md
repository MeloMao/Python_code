# About this
There are my little Python programs records(just written by myself).

### Ceasar
It's the most simple encrypt in the world. I achieved it by Python.
It has three parts, ceasar_encrypt,ceasar_decipher and ceasar_bundle,ceasar_bundle has all function.

### M
It's a user-defined encrypt program,its structure like AES encrypt(yeah,I was almost copyed it,but more simple,it was just for study).
It has three types of operation to complete encryption.
M2.0 is a update program form M,it repeat 9 times same encypt to complete encryption.
