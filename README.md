#First of all
This is my little Python programs records.

#Ceasar
It's the most simple encrypt in the world. I achieved it by Python.
It has three parts, ceasar_encrypt,ceasar_decipher and ceasar_bundle,ceasar_bundle has all function.

#M
It's a user-defined encrypt program,its structure like AES encrypt(yeah,I almost copy it,but more simple,it just for study).
It has three types of operation to complete encryption.
M2.0 is a update program form M,it repeat 9 times same encypt to complete encryption.
